We used [Replit](https://replit.com) to host the website and collaborate with group members online (Pre 2024) and a free SQL hosting service, [freesqldatabase](https://www.freesqldatabase.com/).

***Please note that the use of the free SQL hosting service was purely for the purposes of this project.***
## Replit Hosting

Run the `replitDatabaseScript.sql` code into a hosted database to use a set up the database (it also includes test logins and list of exercises)
